# DTSimioRL
Digital Twin Reinforcement Learning algorithm for Simio

# How to use
Step0 : step 0 for scenario 1<br>
Step02 : step 0 for scenario 2<br>
Step1 : step 1 for scenario 1<br>
Step12 : step 1 for scenario 2<br>
Step2 : step 2 for scenario 1<br>
Step22 : step 2 for scenario 2<br>
Step3 : step 3 for scenario 1<br>
Step32 : step 3 for scenario 2<br>

For both scenarios:<br>
step 0 creates Qtable<br>
step 1 computes a random action for training phase<br>
step 2 calculates the Q table<br>
step 3 returns the action of the max Q for using (testing) phase<br>
<br>
